    <h3>
        Bootstrap
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        I did not use any template in this. I first began by adding a number of bootstrap features, firstly the nav-bar which allows the user to navigate to the different section in the page. The nav bar used is also collapsable so it works well with mobile devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bootstrap grid layout was used to postion elements on the page in there most approprate locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bootstrap buttons used
    </p>
    <p>
        The collapsable and responsive images were used so that the page would work with mobile devices
    </p>
    <p>
        A popup modal was used in the contact section and also in the projects section to show the details of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The carousel was used in the projects section to cycle though the different projects that have been completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bootstrap alerts were also used to notify the user when there message has been sent on the contact modal
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Javascript/jQuery
    </h3>
    <p>
        jQuery/Javascript were used when the user selects a section they wish to navgate to on the navabar and the page will auto scroll to that section
    </p>
    <p>
        Javascript was also used to add a show more/ show less button on certain sections to hide extra text
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Dynamic Content inclding Extra Javascript
    </h3>
    <p>
        I added the ability for the user to download my current CV
    </p>
    <p>
        Javascript was used to find the current data and time and then displayed in the navbar
    </p>
    <h3>
        Other
    </h3>
    <p>
        A google map was added to the bottom of the site with the pin at tallaght IT
    </p>
    <p>
        Font awesome icons were used to provide links the site to other social media and github
    </p>
